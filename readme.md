[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats) introduced a challenge to determine how to distinguish images of cats v dogs.  There have been some magnificent entries and Fr*ancois Chollet uses this competition in his book "Deep Learning with Python" to introduce topics in computer vision.  

This repo is my solution to this challenge.  I go through:  
* Setting up the directory strucuture  
* Building a convolution neural network to solve the problem  
* Using data augmentation to improve the network  
* Optimising that network  
* Transfer learning
